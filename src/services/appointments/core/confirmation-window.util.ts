 * the frontend's countdown is always in sync with what the backend will
 * actually do.

 * Returns `null` when:
 * - date/time can't be derived from the row
 * - the appointment type doesn't participate in auto-expiry
 *
 * Frontend reads `confirmationExpiresAt` from the API response (populated
 * when the row was last CONFIRMED) and renders a live "Expires in"
 * countdown against it.
